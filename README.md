# OpenSea Vue Starter

Super-simple starter with OpenSea / Web3. 

Using `opensea-js` we first fetch an order for a specific contract / tokenId, then we render the button to buy the item.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
